# confluence-vim
A vim plugin for taking notes in markdown and storing them in a confluence wiki.

It's really simple, I hope you like it.

You need to install html2text, markdown, and requests, and your vim needs to
be compiled with python support. You also need to write your credentials in
your .netrc file.
